The Polyscripting plugin provides an ease of use access panel when it comes to scrambling, rescrambling, and unscrambling your WordPress site.

== Description ==
The Polyscripting plugin requires users to atleast have a Polyscript-able Wordpress image for compatablity. The plugin opens a line of communication 
allowing site admins to perform critical tasks, such as updates, by merely navigating to the plug-in(either throuhg the plugin tab or other custom 
options which the user may set) and simply disabling Polyscripting. Once said task is completed, re-Polyscripting the site is as simple as clicking 
the Scramble button. Note that there will be a few minutes delay from the time any operation(scramble, unscramble, rescramble) is commenced and when 
the corresponding changes take place; During this delay it is highly recommended not to make any updates or major changes to the site.
