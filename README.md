# Polyscripting

The Polyscripting plugin provides an ease of use access panel when it comes to scrambling, rescrambling, and unscrambling your WordPress site.

### Description
The Polyscripting plugin requires users to atleast have a Polyscript-able Wordpress image for compatablity.
Refer to repo for setup FAQ and building a Polyscriptable WordPress Image:

Once the polyscripting site is setup, this plugin allows users to scramble, rescramble, and unscramble the wordpress site via WordPress UI.

This plugin also allows a live view of the current state of the site: polyscripting disabled or enabled to allow transparency to the current site status.

It also allows access to the site's polyscripting history and health updates on the containers serving the wordpress site.
